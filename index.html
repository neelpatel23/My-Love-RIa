              Each and every day I miss you. I miss you so much! I don’t mean to
              sound whiny or crazy, but I do. I am willing and wanting to put in the same effort that you do.
              I still do think that you are the one. I will never forget our time spent together.
              Our time now and forever will be cherished. I can't wait until we are together at IU, 
              and its just me and you looking through pictures together and laughing back at each other's "Raghlo & Raghlee Moments"
              I can’t help but miss you when I see all the
              cutesy things everyone else is doing. I really wish I could have turned things around a long time ago and I am glad to
              finally be able to take control and responsibility to change my life, for you and for ourselves.
            </h2>
            <h2 class="title2">
              I totally understand that the distance between us is just a silly
              number and that it is just a temporary thing. I don’t even want
              you to drop everything and materialize beside me - but part of me
              wishes you could. It is probably very selfish of me to wish for
              something like that, and I feel very stupid for doing so. But there is
              this very little part of my gut that still wants you pick fights with me 
              but when we're in person, not for you to get hurt by a pillow, but for us
              to get tired and just fall onto the bed our couch and lay on each other.
            </h2>
            <h2 class="title2">
              So what if we can't celebrate Valentine’s Day together? It
              doesn’t define our relationship, does it? And it isn’t the end of
              time, either! There’ll be many more Valentine’s Days to be
              celebrated with you (I’m hoping!), and everything will be alright.
              Besides, we don’t need a Valentine’s Day to tell each other how
              much we mean to each other. I don't want to undermine that times 
              and left out times that I could have had with you but now I want
              to reciprocate what you give me, you've given me the unthinkable
              this past 1 year and compared to I have contribted 0 to this relationship
              and I want to change that and take a U-turn (with my old car) back and 
              bring back the cherishable Neel!
            </h2>
            <h2 class="title2">
              The truth is that I miss you and I am
              waiting for the day I’ll get to see you right next to me, every second 
              of the day and every millisecond of my life and tell you how much I
              love you! Until then, I guess I’ll just have to be
              patient - which I will be; and with I want to grow my love for you,
              not within myself but alongside you.
            </h2>

            <h2 class="title2">
              Last but not least, Ria, Riu, Monkey, Sleeping Beauty, Niru's mummy, Reyu's mummy,
              and my beloved girlfriend, best-friend, and my fiance (if I put a ring on your finger --> SIZE 4, I remember) 
              and my forever Wife, will you be my Valentine?. I
              love you so much, and you know that. I miss you and I’m hoping you
              be the one you deserve and asked for very soon. There are walks and dates to go on, lots of our silly ideas
              that can and should have been done. I hope to be the one for you, now and forever!
